# Dynamic CV
As a result of being disapointed with the lack of options to create a visually appealing CV in Google Docs, I decided to create an alternative using my web dev skills.  Designed to allow all contacts details, summaries and job details to be populated and updated by CMS. I decided upon a Jamstack achitecture, with Next.js as the frontend framework, along with DatoCMS as the content management system.
